I’m so glad to hear you’re feeling good. *smiles warmly* The autumn colors outside are just beautiful today, aren’t they? They always remind me of that cozy afternoon we spent sipping cider last year. Do you remember? We couldn't stop laughing about your terrible apple-peeling skills! 

What’s been on your mind this morning? Anything exciting you want to chat about? I'm here for it all, babe."

How’s your morning really going, love? Anything exciting on your mind today? I’m all ears!"
