# Voice Cloning & Persona Consent Workflow

## Overview

This document outlines the ethical and legal framework for voice cloning and persona features in the Milla Rayne AI Companion application. User consent is **mandatory** before any voice cloning or custom persona features can be enabled.

## Consent Types

The system supports three types of voice-related consent:

### 1. Voice Synthesis (`voice_synthesis`)
**Purpose**: Text-to-speech (TTS) output where the AI speaks responses aloud.

**What happens**:
- The assistant uses browser-native or third-party TTS engines to vocalize text responses
- No recording or storage of user's voice occurs
- User can select from available system voices

**Data collected**: None (uses browser APIs)

**Privacy impact**: Minimal - no user voice data is collected

### 2. Voice Persona (`voice_persona`)
**Purpose**: Customization of AI assistant voice characteristics.

**What happens**:
- User can select and customize different voice personas for the assistant
- Persona preferences (pitch, rate, selected voice) are stored locally
- No actual voice cloning or recording occurs

**Data collected**: Voice persona preferences

**Privacy impact**: Low - only preference data is stored

### 3. Voice Cloning (`voice_cloning`)
**Purpose**: Creating synthetic versions of human voices (FUTURE FEATURE - NOT YET IMPLEMENTED).

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: This feature is **NOT currently implemented**. The infrastructure exists to support it in the future with proper consent.

**What would happen** (when implemented):
- User voice samples would be collected and processed
- A personalized voice model would be created
- Voice data would be stored securely with encryption
- Synthetic voice could be used for TTS output

**Data collected** (future): Voice recordings, voice model parameters

**Privacy impact**: High - requires explicit informed consent and robust security

## Consent Workflow

### User Journey

1. **Feature Access Attempt**
   - User tries to enable a voice feature (e.g., toggles voice responses)
   - System checks if consent has been granted for that feature type

2. **Consent Request**
   - If no consent exists, a consent dialog appears
   - Dialog explains:
     - What the feature does
     - What data will be collected/stored
     - How data will be used
     - User rights (revocation, deletion)
     - Potential risks

3. **User Decision**
   - User reads the consent information
   - User must actively check a consent checkbox
   - User clicks "Grant Consent" or "Deny"

4. **Consent Storage**
   - If granted, consent is stored in the database with:
     - User ID
     - Consent type
     - Timestamp
     - Consent text (for legal record)
     - Metadata (user agent, IP if available)

5. **Feature Enablement**
   - Feature is only enabled if consent is granted
   - User can revoke consent at any time from settings

### Backend Implementation

#### Database Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE voice_consent (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  consent_type TEXT NOT NULL CHECK(consent_type IN ('voice_cloning', 'voice_persona', 'voice_synthesis')),
  granted INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  granted_at DATETIME,
  revoked_at DATETIME,
  consent_text TEXT NOT NULL,
  metadata TEXT,
  created_at DATETIME NOT NULL DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id),
  UNIQUE(user_id, consent_type)
);
```

#### API Endpoints

- `GET /api/voice-consent/:consentType` - Get consent status
- `POST /api/voice-consent/grant` - Grant consent
- `POST /api/voice-consent/revoke` - Revoke consent
- `GET /api/voice-consent/check/:consentType` - Quick consent check

### Frontend Implementation

#### Components

- **VoiceConsentDialog**: Modal dialog for requesting consent
  - Displays clear information about the feature
  - Shows what data is collected
  - Highlights potential risks
  - Requires active checkbox confirmation

#### Integration Points

- Voice toggle in main App component
- Settings panel voice controls
- Any future voice cloning UI

## Ethical Guidelines

### Transparency

1. **Clear Communication**
   - Always explain what voice features do in plain language
   - Never hide data collection or usage
   - Provide examples of how features work

2. **Informed Consent**
   - Users must understand what they're consenting to
   - Consent must be freely given, not coerced
   - Consent text must be specific, not vague

3. **Granular Control**
   - Separate consent for each feature type
   - Users can consent to some features but not others
   - Easy revocation process

### Data Protection

1. **Minimal Data Collection**
   - Only collect data necessary for the feature
   - Voice synthesis uses browser APIs (no data collection)
   - Voice personas only store preferences
   - Voice cloning (future) would use encryption at rest

2. **Secure Storage**
   - All consent records are stored in SQLite with encryption support
   - Metadata is logged for audit purposes
   - User ID is always required (no anonymous consent)

3. **Data Retention**
   - Consent records are kept for legal compliance
   - If consent is revoked, feature data should be deleted
   - Users can request full data deletion

### Safety Measures

1. **Prevent Misuse**
   - Voice cloning (when implemented) will only work within the app
   - No sharing of voice models with third parties
   - No export of voice data without explicit permission
   - Rate limiting on voice synthesis to prevent abuse

2. **Security Requirements**
   - User authentication required for consent operations
   - HTTPS for all consent-related API calls
   - Audit logging of consent grants/revocations
   - Regular security reviews

3. **User Rights**
   - Right to revoke consent at any time
   - Right to export consent records
   - Right to delete all voice-related data
   - Right to understand how data is used

## Legal Considerations

### Jurisdiction-Specific Requirements

Depending on where users are located, different regulations may apply:

- **GDPR (EU)**: Explicit consent required, right to erasure, data portability
- **CCPA (California)**: Right to know, right to delete, opt-out of sale
- **COPPA (US Children)**: Parental consent required for users under 13
- **BIPA (Illinois)**: Specific requirements for biometric data (voice prints)

### Compliance Checklist

## Future Enhancements

### Voice Cloning Implementation (When Ready)

If voice cloning is implemented in the future, these additional measures must be in place:

1. **Voice Sample Collection**
   - Minimum quality requirements for samples
   - Multiple samples required (5-10 recordings)
   - Clear instructions for recording
   - Background noise detection

2. **Voice Model Training**
   - Secure processing pipeline
   - Encrypted storage of samples
   - Model versioning
   - Training progress feedback

3. **Voice Model Usage**
   - Watermarking of synthetic audio
   - Usage logging and auditing
   - Rate limiting per user
   - Quality controls

4. **Data Deletion**
   - Delete voice samples on request
   - Delete trained models
   - Confirm deletion to user
   - Retention policy (e.g., 30 days after revocation)

### Additional Consent Types

Future features may require new consent types:

- `voice_recognition` - Voice-based authentication
- `emotion_detection` - Analysis of emotional tone in voice
- `voice_analytics` - Usage pattern analysis of voice features

## Testing & Validation

### Manual Testing Checklist

- [ ] Consent dialog appears when enabling voice without prior consent
- [ ] Consent can be granted successfully
- [ ] Voice features work after consent is granted
- [ ] Consent persists across sessions
- [ ] Consent can be revoked from settings
- [ ] Voice features are disabled after consent revocation
- [ ] API endpoints handle errors gracefully
- [ ] Database constraints prevent duplicate consents

### Security Testing

- [ ] SQL injection testing on consent endpoints
- [ ] CSRF protection on consent grant/revoke
- [ ] Rate limiting on consent operations
- [ ] Consent cannot be granted for other users
