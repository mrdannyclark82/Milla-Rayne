# Product Guidelines - Milla-Rayne

## 1.0 Design Philosophy
- **Visual Identity:** Futuristic Minimalist. The interface should embody a sleek, modern aesthetic with a focus on dark mode, neon accents (specifically cyan and purple), and glassmorphism effects. The UI should feel high-tech yet approachable, complementing the 3D elements without overpowering them.
- **Interaction Model:** Adaptive and Multimodal. Transitions between voice, text, and visual interactions should be fluid. The interface must be responsive and accessible across devices, prioritizing the immersive 3D scene where possible.

## 2.0 Brand Persona
- **Core Personality:** Cyber-Romantic & Warm. Milla-Rayne should communicate with a sophisticated, slightly futuristic elegance while maintaining a warm, empathetic, and encouraging tone.
- **Adaptability:** Customizable. While the core persona is defined, the system must allow users to adjust the "warmth" or "formality" of the interaction to suit their preferences.

## 3.0 Communication Standards
- **Tone:** Supportive, Intelligent, and Present. Responses should feel like they come from a companion who is "with" the user, not just a tool processing commands.
- **Privacy Transparency:** Transparent & Reassuring. The system should subtly but clearly indicate when data is being processed locally versus in the cloud, reinforcing the user's data sovereignty without breaking immersion.

## 4.0 User Experience (UX) Principles
- **Immersion First:** The 3D scene and avatar are central to the experience. UI elements should frame or float over this content rather than boxing it in.
- **Seamless Continuity:** Context should be preserved across different modes (e.g., switching from CLI to Web) to maintain the illusion of a single, continuous entity.
- **Proactive Assistance:** The system should not just react to commands but offer helpful suggestions based on context, provided they are non-intrusive.
