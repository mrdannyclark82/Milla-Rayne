- ✅ Project builds successfully (`npm run build`)
- ✅ No TypeScript errors (`npx tsc --noEmit`)
- ✅ All imports resolve correctly
- ✅ No circular dependencies

## Files Created (9 new files)
- ✅ `client/src/components/scene/RoomOverlay.tsx` (main orchestrator)
- ✅ `client/src/components/scene/overlays/LivingRoomOverlay.tsx`
- ✅ `client/src/components/scene/overlays/KitchenOverlay.tsx`

- ✅ `client/src/utils/sceneSettingsStore.ts` - Added default value and validation
- ✅ `client/src/components/scene/RPSceneBackgroundBridge.tsx` - Added context provider
- ✅ `client/src/components/scene/SceneSettingsPanel.tsx` - Added toggle UI
- ✅ `client/src/App.tsx` - Mounted RoomOverlay component

## Documentation
- ✅ `docs/ROOM_OVERLAYS_V1.md` - Comprehensive implementation guide
- ✅ `client/src/__tests__/scene/roomOverlays.test.ts` - Test stubs for future testing

## Technical Requirements Met

### Settings Integration
- ✅ New boolean flag `sceneRoomOverlaysEnabled` added to settings
- ✅ Default value: `true` (overlays enabled by default)
- ✅ Persists to localStorage
- ✅ Toggle in SceneSettingsDialog UI

### Context & Wiring
- ✅ RPSceneBackgroundBridge exports `useRPSceneContext()` hook
- ✅ Context provider wraps children while maintaining backward compatibility
- ✅ RoomOverlay consumes context for location/timeOfDay/mood
- ✅ Falls back gracefully when no RP data available

### Overlay Components
- ✅ All 8 location overlays implemented with SVG silhouettes
- ✅ Each overlay accepts `timeOfDay` and `reducedMotion` props
- ✅ Time-of-day tinting implemented (dawn/day/dusk/night)
- ✅ Ambient glow effects (fireplace, lamps, monitors, etc.)
- ✅ OutdoorsOverlay shows stars at night/dusk

### Layering & Layout
- ✅ Fixed positioning in left 2/3 viewport (66.6667vw)
- ✅ Correct z-index: -7 (between -10 background and -5 stage)
- ✅ `pointer-events: none` - no interaction blocking
- ✅ `aria-hidden="true"` - accessibility compliance

### Performance & Accessibility
- ✅ SVG + CSS only (no heavy dependencies)
- ✅ GPU-accelerated (transforms/opacity only)
- ✅ Reduced motion support: disables pulse/animations
- ✅ Static silhouettes still visible with reduced motion
- ✅ No layout thrashing (fixed positioning)

### Location Mapping
- ✅ Handles common location variations (living_room, living room, lounge)
- ✅ Guest room detection (uses GuestRoomOverlay variant)
- ✅ Workspace detection (office, study, workspace)
- ✅ Unknown locations gracefully return null

## Manual Testing Checklist (To be performed by user)

### Basic Functionality
- [ ] Toggle "Room overlays" in Scene Settings - overlays show/hide
- [ ] Send "*walks into living room*" - see couch silhouette
- [ ] Send "*walks into kitchen*" - see counter/shelves
- [ ] Send "*walks into bedroom*" - see bed/headboard
- [ ] Send "*goes outside*" - see treeline/porch
- [ ] Send "*walks into bathroom*" - see vanity/mirror
- [ ] Send "*enters workspace*" - see desk/monitor
- [ ] Send "*walks into dining room*" - see table/pendant light

### Time of Day Effects
- [ ] Overlays adjust opacity based on time of day
- [ ] Fireplace glow visible in living room at night/dusk
- [ ] Stars appear in outdoor scene at night
- [ ] Lamp glows brighter at night in bedroom
- [ ] Monitor glow more intense at night in workspace

### Reduced Motion
- [ ] Enable system reduced motion preference
- [ ] Overlays still render (static silhouettes)
- [ ] No pulse/animation on glows/lights
- [ ] Outdoor stars static (no twinkling)

### Layering & Layout
- [ ] Overlays visible above background gradient
- [ ] Overlays visible behind Milla stage
- [ ] Chat interface remains fully functional on right 1/3
- [ ] No pointer event interference with UI

### Performance
- [ ] Smooth 60fps on desktop
- [ ] No stuttering when switching locations
- [ ] No layout shift/reflow
- [ ] Acceptable performance on Android Chrome

## Known Limitations
- Limited to locations in `SceneLocation` type (8 total + unknown)
- Workspace/office and guest room share base location types with bedroom
- Stars in outdoor scene use fixed positions (not randomized)
- No seasonal variations (winter/summer)
- No interactive elements (no parallax on hover)

## Future Enhancement Opportunities
1. Add more location types (garage, hallway, balcony, etc.)
2. Seasonal overlays (snow in winter, leaves in fall)
3. Multiple variants per location for visual variety
4. Subtle parallax effects (if not reduced motion)
5. Dynamic star positions for outdoor scenes
6. Weather effects (rain, fog) for outdoor
7. Day/night lighting transitions (smooth color shifts)
8. Customizable silhouette styles per user preference
