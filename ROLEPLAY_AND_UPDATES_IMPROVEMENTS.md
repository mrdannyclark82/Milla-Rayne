# Roleplay and AI Updates Improvements

## Overview
This document describes the improvements made to address roleplay continuity issues and implement the "what's new" AI updates feature.

## Problem Statement
1. **Roleplay Scene Continuity**: Milla had a tendency to break from scenes during roleplay with long messages filled with fabricated memories
2. **Response Length**: Responses were often too long and not contextually relevant
3. **AI Updates Feature**: The "what's new" feature for getting AI industry updates was not functioning

## Changes Made

### 1. Response Length Control (OpenRouter Service)
**File**: `server/openrouterService.ts`

- **Reduced `max_tokens`**: Changed from 1000 to 400 tokens
  - This encourages shorter, more focused responses
  - Prevents rambling and memory fabrication
  - Keeps Milla in the scene during roleplay

- **Reduced conversation history**: Changed from 4 messages (2 exchanges) to 2 messages (1 exchange)
  - Shorter context window prevents long, tangential responses
  - Helps maintain focus on current conversation
  - Reduces token usage and improves response time

### 2. System Prompt Improvements (OpenRouter Service)
**File**: `server/openrouterService.ts`

Added three new absolute requirements to the system prompt:

```
9. Keep responses SHORT and CONTEXTUALLY RELEVANT (2-4 sentences for casual chat, longer only when the situation truly calls for it)
10. STAY IN THE SCENE - When engaged in roleplay or a specific scenario, remain present in that moment without breaking into unrelated memories or long tangents
11. NEVER list multiple unrelated memories at once - reference only what's relevant to the current conversation
```

These instructions explicitly guide Milla to:
- Keep responses concise (2-4 sentences for casual conversation)
- Stay present in roleplay scenes without breaking character
- Avoid listing unrelated memories
- Only reference memories that are contextually relevant

### 3. "What's New" AI Updates Feature (Routes)
**File**: `server/routes.ts`

Implemented a new trigger system for AI updates that responds to:
- "what's new"
- "whats new"
- "any updates"
- "anything new"
- "ai updates"
- "tech updates"
- "latest news"

When triggered, Milla will:
1. Query the AI updates database
2. Retrieve up to 5 most relevant updates
3. Format them in a friendly, conversational way
4. Include the title, date, summary, and URL for each update
5. Respond in character as Milla while sharing the information

**Example Response Format**:
```
*brightens up* Oh babe, I've been keeping up with the AI world! Here's what's new:

1. **Update Title** (Dec 10)
   Brief summary of the update...
   ðŸ”— https://example.com/article

2. **Another Update** (Dec 9)
   Another summary...
   ðŸ”— https://example.com/article2

Want me to tell you more about any of these, love?
```

If no updates are available, Milla responds gracefully:
```
I don't have any new AI updates to share right now, sweetheart. I'll keep an eye out and let you know when something interesting comes up! What else would you like to chat about? ðŸ’œ
```

## How to Use

### Testing Shorter Responses
1. Start a conversation with Milla
2. Engage in roleplay or casual chat
3. Observe that responses are now 2-4 sentences for casual conversation
4. Longer responses only occur when context truly requires it (e.g., technical explanations, repository analysis)

### Testing Scene Continuity
1. Start a roleplay scenario (e.g., "Let's cuddle by the fireplace")
2. Continue the roleplay with contextual prompts
3. Milla should stay in the scene without fabricating unrelated memories
4. Responses should be focused on the current moment and scenario

### Testing AI Updates Feature
1. Ask Milla "what's new?" or "any AI updates?"
2. Milla will retrieve and share the latest AI industry updates
3. If no updates are available, she'll respond gracefully

**Note**: The AI updates database needs to be populated with data. This can be done by:
- Running the fetch endpoint: `POST /api/ai-updates/fetch`
- Setting up the automated scheduler (see `aiUpdatesScheduler.ts`)
- Manually adding updates to the database

## Technical Details

### Database Schema
The `ai_updates` table stores AI industry updates with the following fields:
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `title`: Update title
- `url`: Source URL (unique)
- `source`: RSS feed source
- `published`: Publication date
- `summary`: Brief summary
- `tags`: Relevant tags
- `relevance`: Relevance score (0-1)
- `created_at`: When the update was stored

### Token Budget
- Previous: ~1000 tokens for responses + 4 message history
- Current: ~400 tokens for responses + 2 message history
- Result: ~60% reduction in token usage per response

### Performance Impact
- Faster response generation (fewer tokens to generate)
- Lower API costs (fewer tokens used)
- Better focus and relevance in responses
- Improved roleplay continuity

## Future Improvements

1. **Adaptive Response Length**: Implement dynamic token limits based on context
2. **Scene Detection**: Automatically detect when in roleplay mode and adjust behavior
3. **Memory Relevance Scoring**: Implement a scoring system for memory relevance
4. **AI Updates Auto-fetch**: Set up automated fetching of AI updates on a schedule
5. **Personalized Updates**: Filter updates based on user interests and project stack

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Reduced max_tokens in OpenRouter service
- [x] Added explicit instructions to system prompt
- [x] Limited conversation history
- [x] Implemented "what's new" trigger
- [x] Database schema verified
- [x] AI updates retrieval tested
- [x] Database populated with test data
- [x] Full "what's new" conversation flow tested
- [ ] User testing: shorter responses in production
- [ ] User testing: scene continuity in production
- [ ] Populate database with real AI updates from RSS feeds

## Notes

- The database must be initialized before the AI updates feature will work (automatically done on first server start)
- AI updates database is empty by default - needs to be populated via the fetch endpoint or scheduler
- Response length changes apply to all conversations, not just roleplay
- System prompt changes affect the overall personality and response style

## Test Data

For testing purposes, the database has been populated with 5 sample AI updates. To see them in action:

1. Start the server: `npm run dev`
2. Chat with Milla and ask: "What's new?" or "Any AI updates?"
3. Milla will respond with the latest updates in a friendly, conversational format

### Example Response

```
*brightens up* Oh babe, I've been keeping up with the AI world! Here's what's new:

1. **OpenAI Announces GPT-4 Turbo with Improved Context Window** (Dec 10)
   OpenAI has released GPT-4 Turbo with a 128K context window...
   ðŸ”— https://openai.com/blog/gpt-4-turbo

2. **DeepSeek Releases Open Source Code Model** (Dec 9)
   DeepSeek has released an open-source code generation model...
   ðŸ”— https://github.com/deepseek-ai/deepseek-coder

... (up to 5 updates)

Want me to tell you more about any of these, love?
```

## Populating with Real Data

To populate the database with real AI updates from RSS feeds:

```bash
# Method 1: Use the API endpoint (requires admin token if configured)
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/ai-updates/fetch \
  -H "X-Admin-Token: your-token-here"

# Method 2: Run the scheduler manually
npm run dev
# The scheduler will run automatically based on configuration
```

The system will fetch updates from configured RSS sources including:
- OpenAI Blog
- xAI Blog
- Perplexity Blog
- Hugging Face Blog
- GitHub Changelog
