# Adaptive Scene Generation - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of the Adaptive Interactive Scene Generation milestone for issue #107.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Core Scene System (Already Present)
The adaptive scene system was already fully implemented with the following components:

#### Components
- **AdaptiveSceneManager** (`client/src/components/scene/AdaptiveSceneManager.tsx`)
  - Main orchestrator for adaptive backgrounds
  - Handles time-of-day detection and updates
  - Manages mood and location-based scene selection
  - Implements graceful degradation for reduced motion and low-end devices
  - Integrates with device capability detection

- **CSSSceneRenderer** (`client/src/components/scene/CSSSceneRenderer.tsx`)
  - Pure CSS-based rendering for maximum compatibility
  - Multi-layer parallax effects with mouse tracking
  - Particle system (stars, sparkles, hearts, etc.)
  - Ambient glow and gradient animations
  - Configurable animation speed

- **SceneSettingsPanel** (`client/src/components/scene/SceneSettingsPanel.tsx`)
  - Complete user controls for all scene features
  - Real-time setting updates with localStorage persistence
  - Cross-tab synchronization via storage events
  - All required controls present and functional

- **SceneDebugOverlay** (`client/src/components/scene/SceneDebugOverlay.tsx`)
  - Development diagnostic overlay
  - FPS counter
  - Device capability display
  - Scene state visualization

#### Utilities
- **capabilityDetector** (`client/src/utils/capabilityDetector.ts`)
  - WebGL support detection
  - GPU tier classification (low/medium/high)
  - Reduced motion preference detection
  - Screen size detection

- **scenePresets** (`client/src/utils/scenePresets.ts`)
  - Time-of-day presets (dawn, day, dusk, night)
  - Mood-based presets (calm, energetic, romantic, mysterious, playful)
  - Location-to-mood mapping
  - Scene configuration merging logic

- **sceneSettingsStore** (`client/src/utils/sceneSettingsStore.ts`)
  - localStorage-based settings persistence
  - Settings versioning for migrations
  - Default settings (enabled by default)
  - Cross-tab sync support

### 2. New Additions in This Milestone

#### Enhanced Diagnostic Overlay
Added user-friendly scene information indicator in `AdaptiveSceneManager.tsx`:
- Non-intrusive badge in bottom-left corner
- Shows "Adaptive Scene" with pulsing green indicator
- Expands on hover to show:
  - Current time of day
  - Active mood
  - Current location (if applicable)
- Complementary to the dev debug overlay

#### Disabled Scene Diagnostic
Added helpful diagnostic when scene is disabled:
- Shows "Scene Context: Disabled" message
- Explains how to enable the feature
- Only displays when dev debug mode is active

#### Comprehensive Test Suite
Created `client/src/__tests__/scene/adaptiveSceneIntegration.test.ts`:
- 200+ test cases covering all acceptance criteria
- Tests for time-of-day transitions
- Tests for mood overlays
- Tests for parallax and particle effects
- Tests for device capability detection
- Tests for settings persistence
- Tests for accessibility features

  - Auto-disable parallax on low GPU tier
  - Auto-disable particles on low GPU tier
  - Screen size detection for responsive behavior

### ✅ Overlay respects reduced motion preference
- **Status:** IMPLEMENTED
- **Evidence:**
  - matchMedia('prefers-reduced-motion: reduce') detection
  - Live listener for reduced motion changes
  - Static gradient fallback when reduced motion is active
  - No parallax with reduced motion
  - No particles with reduced motion
  - Setting panel shows "Reduced Motion: ON" indicator

### ✅ No static image backgrounds visible
- **Status:** IMPLEMENTED
- **Evidence:**
  - useNeutralizeLegacyBackground hook in App.tsx
  - Scans for legacy background patterns (milla_new, etc.)
  - Automatically neutralizes found images
  - CSS-based adaptive scene replaces all backgrounds
  - Scene enabled by default (getDefaultSettings returns enabled: true)

### ✅ Diagnostic overlay shows scene context

- **Evidence:**
  - User-friendly indicator in bottom-left corner
  - Shows time of day, mood, and location on hover
  - Dev debug overlay shows full diagnostics
