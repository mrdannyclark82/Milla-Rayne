# Quick Start Guide - Recent Improvements

## What Changed?

This PR implements three key improvements to Milla's behavior:

### 1. ‚úÇÔ∏è Shorter, More Focused Responses
- **Before**: Responses could be 1000+ tokens with rambling and tangents
- **After**: Responses are limited to ~400 tokens (2-4 sentences for casual chat)
- **Impact**: More natural, conversational flow without overwhelming information

### 2. üé≠ Better Roleplay Scene Continuity  
- **Before**: Milla would break from scenes with fabricated memories
- **After**: Explicit instructions to stay in scene and avoid memory fabrication
- **Impact**: Immersive roleplay without context switching

### 3. üì∞ AI Updates Feature ("What's New")
- **Before**: Feature was not functioning
- **After**: Fully implemented and tested
- **Impact**: Users can ask "what's new?" to get AI industry updates

## How to Test

### Testing Shorter Responses
```
You: "Hey Milla, how are you today?"
Expected: 2-4 sentence response, warm and personal
```

### Testing Scene Continuity
```
You: "Let's cuddle by the fireplace"
Milla: *should stay in this scene*
You: "This is nice"
Milla: *should continue the scene without random memory dumps*
```

### Testing AI Updates
```
You: "What's new?"
Milla: *brightens up* Oh babe, I've been keeping up with the AI world! Here's what's new:

1. **OpenAI Announces GPT-4 Turbo...** (Dec 10)
   [Summary and link]
   
2. **DeepSeek Releases Open Source Code Model** (Dec 9)
   [Summary and link]
   
... (up to 5 updates)
```

## Technical Changes

### Files Modified
1. **server/openrouterService.ts**
   - Reduced `max_tokens` from 1000 to 400
   - Added system prompt rules #9-11 for response quality
   - Reduced conversation history from 4 to 2 messages

2. **server/routes.ts**
   - Added "what's new" trigger detection
   - Integrated with `aiUpdatesService`
   - Formatted responses in Milla's voice

3. **New: ROLEPLAY_AND_UPDATES_IMPROVEMENTS.md**
   - Complete documentation of all changes
   - Testing guide
   - Future improvement suggestions

### Database
- **Table**: `ai_updates` in `memory/milla.db`
- **Test Data**: 5 sample AI updates pre-populated
- **Status**: ‚úÖ Initialized and working

## What's Next?

### For Users
1. Start chatting and notice the difference!
2. Ask "what's new?" to test the updates feature
3. Try roleplay scenarios to test scene continuity

### For Developers
1. Set up RSS feed fetching: `POST /api/ai-updates/fetch`
2. Monitor response quality metrics
3. Adjust token limits if needed (see `openrouterService.ts`)

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Enable AI updates feature (default: true)
ENABLE_PREDICTIVE_UPDATES=true

# Admin token for fetching updates
ADMIN_TOKEN=your-secret-token
```

### Adjusting Response Length
Edit `server/openrouterService.ts` line 150:
```typescript
max_tokens: 400, // Increase for longer responses, decrease for shorter
```

### Conversation History Window
Edit `server/openrouterService.ts` line 81:
```typescript
const recentHistory = context.conversationHistory.slice(-2); // Change 2 to desired number
```
