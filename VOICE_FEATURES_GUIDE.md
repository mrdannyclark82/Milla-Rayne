// Speech rate (0.1 to 10, default: 0.95)
utterance.rate = 0.95;

// Pitch (0 to 2, default: 1.0)
utterance.pitch = 1.0;

// Volume (0 to 1, default: 1.0)
utterance.volume = 1.0;

// Language (default: 'en-US')
recognitionRef.current.lang = 'en-US';
```

## Troubleshooting

### Voice Output Not Working

**Issue**: No sound when Milla responds

**Solutions**:
1. Check system volume is not muted
2. Verify voice is enabled (üîä icon)
3. Try refreshing the browser
4. Check browser console for errors
5. Ensure browser supports speech synthesis

**Test in browser console**:
```javascript
window.speechSynthesis.speak(new SpeechSynthesisUtterance('Test'));
```

### Speech Recognition Not Working

**Issue**: Microphone button does nothing or doesn't capture speech

**Solutions**:
1. Grant microphone permissions when prompted
2. Ensure microphone is connected and working
3. Check browser compatibility (use Chrome/Edge)
4. Verify microphone is not used by another app
5. Try speaking louder or closer to the microphone

**Test in browser console**:
```javascript
const recognition = new webkitSpeechRecognition();
recognition.start();
```

### Microphone Permission Denied

**Chrome/Edge**:
1. Click the lock icon in the address bar
2. Find "Microphone" permissions
3. Set to "Allow"
4. Refresh the page

**Safari**:
1. Safari ‚Üí Preferences ‚Üí Websites
2. Click "Microphone"
3. Allow for your site

### Voice Sounds Robotic or Unnatural

**Solutions**:
1. Adjust the speech rate (lower = more natural)
2. Use a different voice (if available on your system)
3. Ensure your OS text-to-speech voices are installed
4. Try updating your operating system

### Speech Recognition Accuracy Issues

**Tips for Better Recognition**:
- Speak clearly and at a moderate pace
- Use a good quality microphone
- Minimize background noise
- Speak in complete sentences
- Avoid very long pauses (recognition may stop)

## Privacy and Security

### Data Handling
- **Speech Recognition**: Processed by your browser and may be sent to browser vendors' speech services (Google for Chrome, Apple for Safari)
- **Text-to-Speech**: Processed locally on your device
- **No Recording**: Your voice is not recorded or stored by the application
- **Transcripts Only**: Only the text transcription is sent to the server

### Microphone Access
- Only active when you click the microphone button
- Visual indicator (pulsing button) shows when listening
- Automatically stops after you finish speaking
- No background recording

## Advanced Usage

### Continuous Conversation Mode

4. Review the text
5. Click "Send"
6. Listen to Milla's spoken response

2. Use keyboard shortcut (Enter) to send messages
3. Tab to navigate to microphone button
4. Space/Enter to activate microphone

### Multilingual Support
